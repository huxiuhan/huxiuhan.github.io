Hello, welcome to my homepage. My name is 胡修涵 (Hu Xiuhan, family name first). You can also call me Chris, I have been using it since high school. As you can see, my nickname is SQRH on the Internet, which is an alias for the abbreviation of my real name.

I define myself as a technology enthusiast, a rubyist and a curious observer. I believe the development of the computer and the cybers are positive to human beings, and programmers should be proud of coding as poets satisified by poeming.

I am currently a M.S. student in Computer Science from Columbia University. I was a undergraduate from [Machine Intelligence Department](http://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University, and my high school is Yali High School in Changsha, Hunan.

If you want to contact me, please have a look at [Github](https://github.com/huxiuhan), [RenRen](http://www.renren.com/huxiuhan), or send an email to <img src="/images/gmail.png" alt="" style="padding:0;margin:0;border:0;border-radius:0">
